This project is about a simple humidity sensor based on 8051 microcontroller. Humidity sensor is also called hygrometer. This circuit can sense relative humidity (RH)  from 20% to 95% at an accuracy of 5%. The humidity information is displayed on a 16Ã—2 LCD display. A relay is also provided which is set to be active when the humidity crosses a certain trip point. The circuit is mains operated and it is very easy to install. DHT11 is the humidity sensor used here. 
Physical quantities like Humidity, temperature, pressure etc. are monitored to get information about the environmental conditions. 

Various sensors are being used to measure these quantities in analog form. This  demonstrates the principle and operation of interfacing the humidity sensor with 8051 microcontroller (AT89C51). The humidity sensor is widely used in applications like weather forecast, air conditioner, Hygrometers etc.Click to read more about humidity sensor and its working

Temperature and humidity sensors are among the most commonly used environmental sensors. Humidity sensors are also sometimes referred to as hygrometers. These devices are used to provide the actual humidity condition within the air at any given point or in any given place. Such devices are commonly used in situations in which air conditions may be extreme or where air conditions need to be controlled due to varying reasons.
